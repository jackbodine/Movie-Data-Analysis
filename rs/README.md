# Rotten_Tomatoes_Review_Scraping_Python_Project
Project to develop a script using beautiful soup to scrape movie reviews from the website Rotten Tomatoes. This code was developed as a part of a small class project for Web-Mining at Stevens School of business and is strictly for the purpose of helping python beginner coders to learn and grow. 
The following is the question for the project if you want to give it a try on your own first:

Create a script named reviews.py

Your script should define a function run() that accepts the url to a movie on RottenTomatoes. It should then create a text file that includes the following information for each review in the first 2 review pages for the movie:

- the name of the critic 

- the rating. The rating should be 'rotten' ,  'fresh', or 'NA' if the review doesn't have a rating.

- the source (e.g 'New York Daily News') of the review. This  should be 'NA' if the review doesn't have a source.

- the text of the review. This  should be 'NA' if the review doesn't have text.

- the date of the review. This should be  'NA' if the review doesn't have a date.

The file should include one line for each review. The reviews in the file should appear in the same order as they do on the website. The 5 values that you write for each movie should be written in the order listed above. The 5 values should be separated by a comma.
